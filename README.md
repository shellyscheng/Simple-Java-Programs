# Linked-List-Manipulation
 Write a class for managing a linked list of strings in alphabetical order.  Use the class in a program to keep an alphabetical list of animals.  Include an appropriate GUI for input and output.  There should be at least be a text field for inputting an animal name and buttons for performing the following tasks:  Add a name, Delete a name, Find a name, List all names.  The output should appear in a JTextArea that is scrollable. You may want to display the list after each operation. 
 
Options:   
1. Make the list a doubly linked list keeping track of the next and previous items. 
2.Imagine you are keeping lists of animals at various zoos.  Use a linked list for the zoos and then include a pointer in each zoo node to the linked list of animals at that zoo.
