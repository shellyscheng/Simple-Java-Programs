Most of the code here from 2016 when I first studied Java

## LinkedList Graphical user interface (GUI)
Write a class for managing a linked list of strings in alphabetical order. Use the class in a program to keep an alphabetical list of animals. Include an appropriate GUI for input and output. There should be at least be a text field for inputting an animal name and buttons for performing the following tasks: Add a name, Delete a name, Find a name, List all names. The output should appear in a JTextArea that is scrollable. You may want to display the list after each operation

## Two Stack Queue
Build a queue out of two completely separate stacks, S1 and S2. Enqueue operations happen by pushing the data
on to stack 1. Dequeue operations are completed with a pop from stack 2. Obviously you will have to find some way to get the input stack information over to the output stack. Your job is to figure out how and when to do that, using only push and pop operations.

## Symbol Balancing

Implement a class called SymbolBalance.java . It should take a the name of a java file as a command line argument. Read in the file and check to make sure that all { }'s, ( )'s, [ ]'s, " "'s, and /* 's are properly balanced. Make sure to ignore characters within literal strings and comment blocks.

## Permutation Box
Permutation for a string

## Greedy Snake Game

[4] [5] [6] 
[7] [8] [9] 

## File
Write a program to read a name and then check to see if it is on a disk file.  If not, add it to the end of the file. The user inputs the name and file either from the console, a JOptionPane, or your GUI.


## Count the frequency of words in a file
A simple Java program that reads a list of words from a word file through the terminal, and removes all redundant words and store the output into another word file.
